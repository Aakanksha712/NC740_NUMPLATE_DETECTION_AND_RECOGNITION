Project Name - Moving Vehicle Resigtration Number Plate Detection
Modules 
    1. Registration number plate detection 
    2. Registration number plate extraction 
    3. Authentication of truck and number plate
    4. Store data on cloud
    5. Fetch data from cloud to display on dashboard

1. Resigtration number plate detection and extraction
    Used python YOLOV5s for detection of number plates
    Used EasyOCR, python image pre-processing libraries for extraction of number plate
    Optical character recognition - OCR is integral part of this project.
    OCR model
    After trying out various OCR models,
    we created own OCR algorithm for extraction
2. Authentication of truck and number plate
     Extracted data from cloud to match it with current value.
